"""
Chaotic Sensing (ChaoS) is a collection of algorithms for image processing and sparse reconstruction.

There are a number of sub-modules:

radon - this houses the finite Radon transform algorithms
mojette - this houses the aperiodic Radon transform algorithms
tomo - this houses the traditional reconstruction algorithms
